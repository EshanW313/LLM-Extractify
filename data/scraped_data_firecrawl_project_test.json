As a Kenyan, I thought of a few companies that could benefit from leveraging the power of such fine-tuned models. I thought of companies like [Safaricom](https://www.safaricom.co.ke/) (Kenya’s largest telco by subscriber base) and [Kenya Airways](https://www.kenya-airways.com/), the national airline, that could benefit by deploying such models to even handle their customer queries in a more “intelligent” way compared to traditional chatbots.\n\nThis is **part one** of a **two-part** series where I build a scraper to get most FAQs about Safaricom products to use later on in fine-tuning an open-source [**Llama 2**](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) Large Language Model on the data and eventually developing a chatbot that users could interact with the fine-tuned model. The second part is [**here**](https://hermanwandabwa.medium.com/c9b226a43106).\n\n# **FAQs Scraper:**\n\nIn the world of data-driven decision-making, access to relevant information is paramount. Therefore, web scraping is a valuable technique for extracting data from websites, and Python offers powerful tools to accomplish this task.\n\nIn this guide, I’ll take you through the step-by-step process that I followed to extract FAQs from Safaricom’s website [here](https://www.safaricom.co.ke/media-center-landing/frequently-asked-questions). This data is what I used to fine-tune the Llama 2 model in the second part of this series.\n\nWith Python, it's always easier to install all the required packages in an “Environment”. Anaconda makes this process quite easy. Details for creating one can be found [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment).\n\n## **1\\. Setting Up the Environment**\n\nBefore diving into web scraping, it’s essential to set up your Python environment with the necessary libraries. In setting up the scraping environment, I made use of the following Python libraries :-\n\n**BeautifulSoup**: This library helps parse HTML and XML documents, making it easier to extract information from web pages.\n\n**Selenium**: Selenium is a web testing framework that allows for the automation of interactions with websites. It’s particularly useful for scraping dynamic content and interacting with JavaScript-driven pages.\n\n**Pandas**: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. We’ll use it to store and manipulate the scraped data efficiently.\n\n**Random**: We use the random library to add random delays between requests to avoid overloading the target website’s server.\n\nYou can install these libraries in a Conda environment using the following commands:\n\n```\nconda create -n webscraper_env python=3.9 #change to the Python version of  your liking\nconda activate webscraper_env\nconda install beautifulsoup4 selenium\n```\n\nOnce your environment is set up, you’re ready to start scraping!\n\n## 2\\. How the Code Works\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the web scraping code is designed to scrape questions and answers from this [URL](https://www.safaricom.co.ke/media-center-landing/frequently-asked-questions). The layout needs to be changed if it is to be used on another website. Let’s delve into how it functions:\n\n**Scraping Architecture**\n\nSelenium with a headless Chrome browser is used to navigate the URL. The webdriver.Chrome object is created, allowing us to interact with web pages programmatically. User-Agent is then set as the header to mimic a legitimate web browser, ensuring that our scraping activity appears less suspicious, and that seems quite common when building web scrapers.\n\nI made use of the function **scrape\\_qa\\_from\\_url** to perform the scraping. The code is below:\n\n```\n#Function to scrape questions and answers from a given URL\ndef scrape_qa_from_url(url,product_type):\n    chrome_options = Options()\n    #Set the User-Agent header to mimic a legitimate web browser\n    chrome_options.add_argument(\"user-agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3\")\n    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)\n    driver.maximize_window()\n    driver.get(url)\n    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 30)\n    time.sleep(random.uniform(10, 30))\n\n    # Store the locator of accordion parent <div> element\n    accordion = wait.until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.ID, 'faqs')))\n    # Parse it into soup\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(accordion.get_attribute('outerHTML'), 'html.parser')\n\n    #Find all the questions and answers\n    questions = soup.find_all('a', class_='card-title')\n    answers = soup.find_all('div', class_='card-body')\n\n    #Create two empty lists to store the questions and answers\n    question_list = []\n    answer_list = []\n\n    #Iterate over the questions and answers\n    for question, answer in zip(questions, answers):\n        question_list.append(question.text.strip())\n\n        try:\n            #Find all the paragraph elements inside the answer element\n            paragraphs = answer.find_all('p')\n            ul_list = answer.find('ul')\n\n            #Combine the text from all paragraphs to get the complete answer\n            answer_text = \"\"\n            for paragraph in paragraphs:\n                answer_text += paragraph.text.strip() + \"\\n\"\n\n            #Check if the answer contains a <ul> tag\n            if ul_list:\n                #Extract the text from each <li> tag and concatenate them to the answer\n                li_list = ul_list.find_all('li')\n                for li in li_list:\n                    answer_text += li.text.strip() + \"\\n\"\n\n            answer_list.append(answer_text)\n        except:\n            #If no answer is found, add an empty string\n            answer_list.append(\"\")\n\n    #Create a DataFrame with the questions and answers\n    df = pd.DataFrame({'Question': question_list, 'Answer': answer_list})\n    driver.quit()\n    return df\n```\n\nThe function above takes two arguments: **url**(the URL of the FAQs page to scrape) and **product\\_type**(a label for the type of product or category being scraped). A headless Chrome WebDriver inside the **scrape\\_qa\\_from\\_url** function is set up using Selenium. This basically maximizes the browser window and sets a User-Agent header to mimic a legitimate web browser.\n\nThe function opens the provided URL, waits for the page to load, and then extracts the HTML of a specific section (the FAQ section identified by an accordion) using BeautifulSoup. Inside the FAQ section, it finds and stores all the questions and answers. It goes through the questions and answers in the FAQs section, extracting and formatting values corresponding to the title (questions) and the body (answers) of the section. There are random delays between requests of up to 30 seconds, mimicking the browsing speeds of humans.\n\nAn iteration through the questions and answers is made, extracting the contents of the sections. If an answer is in table format, a table is parsed; otherwise, text is extracted from paragraphs. The scraped data is then stored in two lists: question and answer lists, and then stored in a Pandas dataframe for further manipulation. About five answers out of the 1755 question-answer pairs were nulls. A simple filter of the five was enough. Below is the complete code that you can re-use in case you have a related problem.\n\n```\ndef scrape_qa_from_url(url,product_type):\n    chrome_options = Options()\n    # Set the User-Agent header to mimic a legitimate web browser\n    chrome_options.add_argument(\"user-agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3\")\n    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)\n    driver.maximize_window()\n    driver.get(url)\n    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 30)\n    time.sleep(random.uniform(10, 30))\n\n    # Store the locator of accordion parent <div> element\n    accordion = wait.until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.ID, 'faqs')))\n    # Parse it into soup\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(accordion.get_attribute('outerHTML'), 'html.parser')\n\n    # Find all the questions and answers\n    questions = soup.find_all('a', class_='card-title')\n    answers = soup.find_all('div', class_='card-body')\n\n    # Create two empty lists to store the questions and answers\n    question_list = []\n    answer_list = []\n\n    # Iterate over the questions and answers\n    for question, answer in zip(questions, answers):\n        question_list.append(question.text.strip())\n\n        try:\n            # Find all the paragraph elements inside the answer element\n            paragraphs = answer.find_all('p')\n            ul_list = answer.find('ul')\n\n            # Combine the text from all paragraphs to get the complete answer\n            answer_text = \"\"\n            for paragraph in paragraphs:\n                answer_text += paragraph.text.strip() + \"\\n\"\n\n            # Check if the answer contains a <ul> tag\n            if ul_list:\n                # Extract the text from each <li> tag and concatenate them to the answer\n                li_list = ul_list.find_all('li')\n                for li in li_list:\n                    answer_text += li.text.strip() + \"\\n\"\n\n            answer_list.append(answer_text)\n        except:\n            # If no answer is found, add an empty string\n            answer_list.append(\"\")\n\n    # Create a DataFrame with the questions and answers\n    df = pd.DataFrame({'Question': question_list, 'Answer': answer_list})\n    driver.quit()\n    return df\n\n# Initialize WebDriver\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome()\ndriver.maximize_window()\nURL = \"https://www.safaricom.co.ke/media-center-landing/frequently-asked-questions\" #replace  with your  URL\ndriver.get(URL)\nwait = WebDriverWait(driver, 30)\ntime.sleep(random.uniform(10, 30))\n\n# Find all sections with class 'col-sm-12 col-md-4 year'\nsections = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, 'col-sm-12.col-md-4.year')\n\n# Create an empty DataFrame to store the final results\nfinal_df1 = pd.DataFrame()\n\n# Loop through each section and scrape questions and answers\nfor section in sections:\n    # Extract links from the current section\n    links = section.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, 'a')\n    hrefs = [link.get_attribute('href') for link in links]\n\n    for sub_url in hrefs:\n        try:\n            product_type_elem = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, 'h1')\n            product_type = product_type_elem.text.strip()\n            df_sub = scrape_qa_from_url(sub_url,product_type)\n            final_df1 = pd.concat([final_df1, df_sub], ignore_index=True)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n            # Refresh the sections list to avoid StaleElementReferenceException\n            sections = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, 'col-sm-12.col-md-4.year')\n\n# Close the WebDriver\ndriver.quit()\n\n# Display the final DataFrame\nprint(final_df1)\n```\n\nWith this guide, you should have a solid foundation for setting up your Python environment for web scraping, understanding the intricacies of our code, and effectively saving the scraped data. I’ll be keen to scrape more details for more complicated use cases in the future.\n\nRemember to scrape responsibly, respecting website terms of service and legal regulations, and happy web scraping!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74)\n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\n\n## Free\n\nDistraction-free reading.

This funding round is the largest private funding round ever for a tech company and will support AI research, infrastructure expansion, and the development of new AI models. OpenAI's revenue is projected to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, up from $3.7 billion in 2024, driven by the success of its ChatGPT product and an increase in paid subscribers, which grew from 15.5 million to over 20 million. Additionally, OpenAI's ChatGPT reached 500 million weekly active users, reflecting significant growth in user engagement and adoption of its AI tools. Despite these successes, OpenAI is currently facing financial challenges, projecting losses of $5 billion against revenues of $3.7 billion for 2024, primarily due to high operational costs associated with its services.\n\nLearn about the companies that matter to you (for free)Get personalized private market analysis\n\n![](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/35429ad1989b4996a19407e018d6460a)\n\n[![OpenAI Logo](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/jjykwqqhsscreywea4gb)\\\\\n\\\\\nOpenAI](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai)\n\nIPO Prediction\n\nIt is possible that OpenAI will IPO\n\n![](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/3789ce3e6b064093878bc90006b25f4d)\n\n[![World Health Organization Logo](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/v1409821525/dahmqzr79zjz2nzyoxzq.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nWorld Health Organization](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/world-health-organization)\n\nProduct Launch\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) launches first-ever guidelines on meningitis diagnosis, treatment and care\n\n![](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/1927570c7ea74b0e8cd89328bbbe73d7)\n\n[![Anthropic Logo](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/02bb58922b3d4d64b082982f275896c8)\\\\\n\\\\\nAnthropic](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anthropic)\n\nGrowth Prediction\n\nIt is possible that Anthropic will grow\n\n![](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/291de711f6514b28b17541de9f6a6fbd)\n\n[![India Exim Bank Logo](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/ykpqinsxykxx1h7uzmi5)\\\\\n\\\\\nIndia Exim Bank](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/india-exim-bank)\n\nInvestor Insight\n\nIndia Exim Bank focuses on debt financing and late-stage investments in financial services, finance, and agriculture sectors, primarily in Mumbai, New Delhi, and Bangalore, India.\n\n![](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/7299fb1a70b6414b8adb52b6d56d486b)\n\n[![Anthropic Logo](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/02bb58922b3d4d64b082982f275896c8)\\\\\n\\\\\nAnthropic](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anthropic)\n\nAcquisition Prediction\n\nIt is possible that Anthropic will be acquired\n\n![](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/931b0664b0f044fd80333d6161490fd6)\n\n[![Dun & Bradstreet Logo](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/v1435794373/mrjideuqvbdejaugkuyf.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nDun & Bradstreet](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dun-and-bradstreet-corporation)\n\nPartnership Announcement\n\nDun & Bradstreet Europe and spektr Strengthen Partnership to Deliver Automated Compliance Solution\n\n![](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/c1ecf22becf54352901f6583f1d7ad49)\n\n[![xAI Logo](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/fx3dkdpnolvubjldo54x)\\\\\n\\\\\nxAI](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/xai)\n\nFunding Prediction\n\nIt is possible that xAI will raise funding\n\n![](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/a3d38ba1298c4cf4974457dedfe13fec)\n\n[![Anthropic Logo](https://www.crunchbase.com/dpr_4/02bb58922b3d4d64b082982f275896c8)\\\\\n\\\\\nAnthropic](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anthropic)\n\nGrowth Insight\n\nAnthropic raised $3.5 billion in a Series E funding round, achieving a post-money valuation of $61.5 billion.
