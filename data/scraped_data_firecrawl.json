These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you (“you,” “User,” “customer”) and Coldbean Inc.\n\nOur [Privacy Policy](https://coldbean.ai/privacy) explains how we collect, safeguard, and disclose information resulting from your use of our web pages and associated services. Please read both these Terms and our Privacy Policy carefully (collectively, the “Agreements”). By accessing or using our Service, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\n\nIf you do not agree with the Agreements, you must not (and do not have our permission to) use the Service.\n\nThese Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service.\n\nWe may modify these Terms, in whole or in part, at our sole discretion. We will post any updated version of these Terms on [**https://coldbean.ai**](https://coldbean.ai/) or provide you notice by another reasonable method. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting or our notifying you, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nCommunications\n\nBy creating an account on our Service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials, and other information we may send. You may opt out of receiving any or all communications from us by following the unsubscribe link in our emails or by emailing **support@coldbean.ai**.\n\nPROHIBITED AND UNAUTHORIZED USE\n\nYou agree not to use the Service in any manner that violates our Acceptable Use policies or these Terms, or for any unlawful or prohibited purpose. Specifically, you will **not**:\n\n1. Directly or indirectly reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to uncover or discover the source code or underlying structure of the Service, any software, documentation, or data related to the Service.\n\n2. Modify, translate, or create derivative works based on the Service (except to the extent expressly permitted by us).\n\n3. Remove any proprietary notices or labels from our materials.\n\n4. Use the Service if prohibited by law in your jurisdiction.\n\n5. Use the Service if your communications or data are subject to laws such as HIPAA, FISMA, or any other regulation for which our Service is not designed.\n\n\n**No Sensitive Information**\n\nThe Service is **not** designed to process Sensitive Information. You agree not to use the Service to collect or process any information that requires special handling under applicable laws (e.g., health data, financial data, or similarly protected information). We disclaim any liability that may result if you use the Service to process Sensitive Information.\n\nCustomer Responsibilities\n\nTo fully benefit from the Service, you may need to provide certain resources and efforts on your end (e.g., a project manager, technical resource, etc.). You are responsible for creating sales personas, setting up and monitoring email campaigns, warming up and adding mailboxes, verifying contact details, and integrating our Service with other sales/marketing systems as needed.\n\nFEES AND SUBSCRIPTION\n\nFree Trial\n\nColdbean Inc. may offer a free trial period (“Free Trial”) at our sole discretion. We may require billing information to begin a Free Trial. If you do not cancel before the Free Trial ends, you may be charged the applicable subscription fees at the start of the billing cycle following the Free Trial. We reserve the right to modify or cancel the Free Trial at any time without notice.\n\nPurchases\n\nWhen you purchase products or services (“Purchase”) through our Service, you may be required to supply certain information (e.g., credit card number, billing address). Payments may be processed by third-party providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). You assume all risk arising from your use of these third-party services.\n\nYou represent that (i) you have the legal right to use any payment method provided, and (ii) the information you supply is true and correct. We may refuse or cancel your order if fraud or unauthorized or illegal transactions are suspected.\n\nFees and Subscription\n\nOur Service may be provided on a subscription basis (“Subscription”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”), which may be monthly or annually, depending on your plan.\n\nThe subscription fee is fixed during the initial term unless you exceed usage limits, upgrade products, subscribe to additional features, or otherwise agree to fee changes. We may also adjust fees downward at our discretion.\n\nAt the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the same conditions unless you cancel it or we cancel it (see “Notice of Non-Renewal”). A valid payment method is required for recurring billing. If automatic billing fails, you must promptly pay all amounts due.\n\nAll fees are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying taxes applicable to your use of the Subscription.\n\nFee Changes\n\nWe may modify Subscription fees at our sole discretion. Any fee change will be effective at the end of your then-current Billing Cycle. We will provide you with reasonable notice of any changes. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes your agreement to the changed fees.\n\nTERM AND RENEWAL\n\nTerm and Renewal\n\nYour initial subscription term is specified in your order form or subscription agreement (“Order”). Unless otherwise stated, your subscription automatically renews for successive periods equal to the initial term (or one year, whichever is shorter).\n\nNotice of Non-Renewal\n\nTo prevent renewal, you must give written notice of non-renewal at least **10 days prior** to the end of your current term. You may do this by emailing **support@coldbean.ai** or adjusting your auto-renew settings in your Coldbean account.\n\nEarly Cancellation\n\nYou may cancel your subscription early; however, **no refunds** will be provided for prepaid fees or unused Subscription periods. You must pay all unpaid fees through the end of your subscription term.\n\nTermination for Cause\n\nEither party may terminate for cause if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure the breach within **30 days** of receiving notice. We may also terminate immediately if you become bankrupt or insolvent, or if we determine you have acted in a manner harmful to us or our users.\n\nRefunds\n\nExcept where required by law, **Subscription fees are non-refundable**.\n\nSUSPENSION\n\nSuspension for Prohibited Acts\n\nWe may suspend your access to the Service without notice if:\n\n1.

Your use of the Service results in excessive bounces, spam complaints, or repeated copyright/trademark infringement notices.\n\n\nSuspension for Non-Payment\n\nIf you fail to pay amounts due, we may suspend your access after providing notice and giving you a grace period. If you dispute charges in good faith and cooperate to resolve the dispute, we will not suspend your account during that process.\n\nSuspension for Present Harm\n\nIf your use of the Service (e.g., website denial of service attacks, security vulnerabilities, excessive bandwidth consumption) threatens our operations or other customers, we may suspend your access. We will attempt to limit the suspension to the problematic use only and promptly resolve the issues.\n\nEffect of Termination or Expiration\n\nUpon termination or expiration, you must stop using the Service. If you terminate for cause, we will refund any prepaid but unused fees. If we terminate for cause, you must pay all fees through the end of the term.

This growth was driven by enterprise and developer adoption, as well as personal use.
