        "content": "# Troubleshooting Circle Home Plus \n\nIf you don't have a Circle Home Plus, open the Circle App and press get Circle Home Plus from the home screen menu.\n\nIf Circle Home Plus isn't pairing with your network via ethernet, make sure the mobile device with the Circle App (most likely your smartphone) is connected to the network created by your router. This way, Circle can verify that the Circle Home Plus you've plugged in is associated with your Circle account.\n\nIf you don't have a spare ethernet port in your router, just skip ethernet pairing by tapping pair with Wi-Fi instead during setup.\n\nIf you skip ethernet pairing, you'll have to connect your phone to the Circle Home Plus hotspot. Follow the instructions in the app, and make sure that you stay connected to the Circle Home Plus hotspot, even though you won't have an Internet connection on your phone for the moment.\n\nIf Circle Home Plus isn't pairing with your network via Wi-Fi, make sure that you've connected to the Circle Home Plus hotspot (if the app required you to do so) before continuing, or that you've correctly entered your Wi-Fi password credentials into the Circle App.\n\nIf you paired Circle Home Plus over ethernet but don't use Wi-Fi, or you're unable to pair wirelessly, just tap skip Wi-Fi pairing during setup.\n\nIf your Circle Home Plus seems to be creating problems for your home network, try temporarily disabling it from the settings screen (found by tapping the menu button in the top-left corner of the home screen, then settings, then disable Circle Home Plus).\n\nIf Circle Home Plus is offline or not working, try rebooting your router and Circle. Set up again by opening the menu and select Remove Circle Home Plus then Resetting Circle.\n\nIf the problem goes away after you've disabled Circle Home Plus, check to make sure that all networking equipment (like a mesh network extender or other network fabric) and smart home devices (like smart thermostats and light bulbs) are set to unmanaged.\n\nHelpful resources to get the most from Circle:\nFAQs\nFeature Guides\nNetworking \\& Compatibility\nTroubleshooting Resources",
